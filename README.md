# In Transit

<strong>What’s it about?</strong>

New York is a city that never holds still. In Transit covers changes and development across all different beats. The purpose of this blog is to tell people how the city became what it is today. It will examine current news and put it in context with the history of the city.

<strong>Who’s the audience?</strong> 

The audience of this site is socially aware local residents. It would probably have a strong pull with younger people and transplants who might not be as informed on the city's past.  

<strong>Competition?</strong>

Ephemeral New York and Jeremiah Vanishes both cover changes in NYC, but they focus mostly on cultural history and rarely on hard news. There is some overlap, but In Transit will have a lot more breadth. Also the data components would set it sufficiently apart. 

<strong>Give us some examples</strong>
